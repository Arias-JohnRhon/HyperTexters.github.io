                        social history have been preserved due to their cultural heritage value. Historic sites are usually 
                        protected by law, and many have been recognized with official historic status.<br>
                        <br>
                        The conservation of historical heritage depends on the legislation of local governing bodies. 
                        In some, a national authority is responsible for the management of all classified sites, while in others regional entities are in charge.<br>

                        and historical documents from the revolution era. The Philippine flag was raised in this house,

                        The Aguinaldo Shrine and Museum is a national shrine in Kawit, Cavite, Philippines, where on June 12, 1898, the Philippine Declaration of Independence from Spain was proclaimed.<br><br>
                        The shrine is Emilio Aguinaldo's ancestral birthplace, the only president of the First Philippine
                        Republic and currently the first President of the Philippines. The house was built in 1845 out of wood and thatch and was demolished in 1849.
                        On March 22, 1869, Aguinaldo was born here.

                        its kind in<br>Asia and the place of the First Philippine Congress in 1898.<br>
